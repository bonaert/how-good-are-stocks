    "To figure this out, we could make a complicated model of the stock market and the world economy, with tons of variables and complicated equations. However, I don't have the time, nor the interest. Instead, I'll simply look at the past and see how much money I would have made if I had bought stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: If I had bought 1000$ worth of S&P500 in March 1998, how much would these shares be worth in 1999? In 2000? In 2005? In 2010? In 2018?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### But doesn't the S&P500 change every year?\n",
    "\n",
    "Every year, some companies leave the S&P500 and others replace them. Therefore, some of the companies I bought in 2010 might not be in the S&P500 in 2015. If that's the case, then I can't use the evolution of the S&P500 to see the evolution of my shares, since the companies in the S&P500 would have changed but not my stocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this problem, I'm assuming we're buying an [index fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_fund) representing the S&P500. Index funds automatically replace the old companies by the new ones in your account, avoiding this problem. As a bonus, index funds have really small fees, which makes them even better."

    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that over a long enough time period, we never lose money. If we invest during 20 years, the minimum we could make was a 4.3% return rate, which is really good. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we invest even longer (30 years), the return rate stabilises at about 7.5% and can vary between 5.75% and 8.6%. On average, our 1000\\$ would transform into 8755\\$, inflation-adjusted! That's an amazing return rate. You could increase your money eight-fold over 30 years by simply re-investing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the extreme situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you invested at the worst possible time (1972) and had to sell everything in 2002 (just after the DotCom bubble crashed), your return rate would have been 5.75%. Thus, your 1000\\$ would have transformed into 5351\\$. Of course, in reality, you would have simply waited a couple of year for the stock market to improve again, so this situation is a absolute worst-case scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you invested at the best possible time (1975) and had to sell everything in 2005 (the stock market had partially recovered from the DotCom bubble crash), your return rate would be 8.6%. Thus, your your 1000\\$ would have transformed into 11882\\$. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, over a long enough time period, the power of compounding is enormous. A 5.75% return rate, over 0 yeas, would more than improve 5-fold your money. A 3% difference, from 5.75% to 8.6% return rate, would more than double the result: you'd more than 11-fold improve your money."
